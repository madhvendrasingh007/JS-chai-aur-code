## Closures

### What is a Closure?

A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function's scope, and the global scope. Closures remember the environment in which they were created.

### Nested Functions

When functions are nested, the inner function has access to variables declared in its own scope as well as variables declared in the outer function's scope.

```javascript
function one() {
    const username = "madhvendra singh";

    function two() {
        const website = "youtube";
        // Inner function can access outer function's variables
        console.log(username);  // "madhvendra singh"
    }
    
    // Outer function cannot access inner function's variables
    // console.log(website);  // ReferenceError: website is not defined
    
    two();
}

one();
```

### Lexical Scoping

JavaScript uses lexical (static) scoping, which means the scope of a variable is determined by its location within the source code.

```javascript
function createGreeting(greeting) {
    // The returned function forms a closure, remembering 'greeting'
    return function(name) {
        return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
    };
}

const sayHello = createGreeting("Hello");
console.log(sayHello("Madhav"));  // "Hello, Madhav!"
```

### Practical Uses

Closures are commonly used for:
- Data privacy (creating private variables)
- Event handlers
- Callback functions
- Factory functions
- Memoization

## Function Declarations

JavaScript provides different ways to declare functions, each with its own characteristics.

### Function Declaration

Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they can be called before they are defined in the code.

```javascript
console.log(addone(5));  // 6 (works before declaration)

function addone(num) {
    return num + 1;
}
```

### Function Expression

Function expressions assign a function to a variable. They are not hoisted, so they cannot be used before they are defined.

```javascript
// addTwo(5);  // Error: addTwo is not a function

const addTwo = function(num) {
    return num + 2;
};

console.log(addTwo(5));  // 7 (works after declaration)
```

### Key Differences

| Feature | Function Declaration | Function Expression |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Hoisting | Yes - can be called before defined | No - must be defined before called |
| Syntax | `function name() {}` | `const name = function() {}` |
| Named functions | Always named | Can be anonymous |
| Use cases | General purpose functions | Callbacks, IIFE, assignments |
